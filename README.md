Hello World Github

Hi there!

I'm Gasty123, right now I'm following the GitHub Hello World tutorial!
At the moment I am studying for a Programming degree but I don't know exactly what I want to become in the future but I'm learning C/C++, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I like playing games so I guess it would be fun making them, in order to do this I'll start learning C#.
If I manage to create something good I will be posting it here in my repository!
My english might be a little broken sometimes, that's because it is not my first language, but I'll try to improve it.
